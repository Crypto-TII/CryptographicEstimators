## Project structure

If you want to add a new estimator please keep in mind the current project structure. You can run `make add-estimator` and it will create the basic code and folder structure for you to edit, you also can review the `DummyEstimator` to see a minimal reproduction of whats its needed to start.

## GIT Conventions
### Commits
To contribute to this project please follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). These are some examples
Type
Must be one of the following:
 - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
 - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (workflows)
 - docs: Documentation only changes
 - feat: A new feature
 - fix: A bug fix
 - perf: A code change that improves performance
 - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
 - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
 - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
 
### Branching
Branch names should be snake_case. Which means that all the text must be lowercase and replace spaces with dashes. Also we should add as a prefix based on the type of implementation. For example:

```
poc/some_testing_branch 
refactor/modify_base_problem
feature/implement_dummy_estimator
fix/algorithm_parameter
```

### Pull request
  1. Only create pull requests to the `develop` branch.
  2. Fulfill the template

---

### Testing
#### Sage tests

To build and run the image based on Dockerfile.test
```sh
make test
```
or if you have Apple Silicon M1 Chip
```sh
make test-m1
```
#### Pytest
```sh
make docker-pytest
```
### Documenting
Remember to document your code using [sphinx syntax](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/automatic-doc-generation.html).
