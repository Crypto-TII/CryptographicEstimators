## Introduction üéâ

This library provides bit complexity estimators for cryptographic problems, as well as some cryptographic schemes.
Currently, the implemented estimators are:

- ### Problem Estimators  
  - Multivariate Quadratic
  - Binary Syndrome Decoding
  - Syndrome Decoding over Fq
  - Permuted Kernel
  - Permutation Equivalence
  - Linear Equivalence
  - MinRank 
  - Regular Syndrome Decoding

- ### Scheme Estimators
  - [BIKE](https://bikesuite.org)
  - [MAYO](https://pqmayo.org)
  - [UOV](https://www.uovsig.org)


This project is meant to be run through a terminal. You can also access the estimators through [this](https://estimators.crypto.tii.ae/) user friendly 
and installation-free web application.

---
## Pre-requisites ‚úîÔ∏è

You would need to have Python installed in your machine.

---
## Installation üõ†

Once you've Python installed you can go to this project folder and run `make install` in a terminal. This will install
`cryptographic_estimators` library locally. If you encounter some permission error please try again adding `sudo` 
as a prefix.


---
## Running the project ‚úàÔ∏è
Open the Python interpreter in a terminal and try importing the library as the following example.
```python
>>> from cryptographic_estimators.SDEstimator import SDEstimator                                                                
>>> SD = SDEstimator(n=15, k=10, w=5)                                                                                                   
>>> SD.table() 
```

## Documentation üìù

The documentation can be found online [here](https://crypto-tii.github.io/CryptographicEstimators/). In addition, it can be generated locally by running `make doc`
or through docker by running `make docker-doc`. Once it is generated, open `docs/build/html/index.html` to see the documentation.  

Additionally, we provide a User Guide [here](https://github.com/Crypto-TII/CryptographicEstimators/blob/main/docs/User_Guide.ipynb).
