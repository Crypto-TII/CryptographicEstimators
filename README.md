## Introduction üéâ

This library provides bit complexity estimators for cryptographic problems, as
well as some cryptographic schemes. Currently, the implemented estimators are:

- ### Problem Estimators
  - Multivariate Quadratic
  - Binary Syndrome Decoding
  - Syndrome Decoding over Fq
  - Permuted Kernel
  - Permutation Equivalence
  - Linear Equivalence
  - MinRank
  - Regular Syndrome Decoding
  - Rank Syndrome Decoding

- ### Scheme Estimators
  - [BIKE](https://bikesuite.org)
  - [MAYO](https://pqmayo.org)
  - [UOV](https://www.uovsig.org)

## Getting Started üöÄ

This project is designed to be run through a terminal as a Python package. You
can also access the estimators through [this](https://estimators.crypto.tii.ae/)
user friendly and installation-free web application.

### Prerequisites ‚úîÔ∏è

You need to have `python3`, `make` and `git` installed on your machine.

**Optional:** If you want to install the package in an isolated
[Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), run
the next commands before the installation process:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Installation üõ†

- Clone and `cd` into the project directory.

- Run `make install` to install the `cryptographic_estimators` library locally.

  _Note:_ If you encounter some permission error, please try creating a virtual
  environment with the steps mentioned in the
  Prerequisites section in this document, so you don't need
  to use `sudo` to interact with python/pip related commands.

### Running the project ‚úàÔ∏è

Open the Python interpreter in a terminal and import the library as shown in the
following example:

```python
>>> from cryptographic_estimators.SDEstimator import SDEstimator
>>> SD = SDEstimator(n=15, k=10, w=5)
>>> SD.table()
```

## Documentation üìù

- A user guide can be found [here](./docs/github/user_guide.md).

- Reference documentation for the library estimators can be found online
  [here](https://crypto-tii.github.io/CryptographicEstimators/), or be generated
  locally with the command `make doc` or `make docker-doc` (see at
  `docs/build/html/index.html` after successful generation).
