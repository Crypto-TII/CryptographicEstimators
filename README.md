## Introduction 🎉

This library provides bit security estimators and asymptotic complexity estimators for cryptographic problems. Some of the implemented estimators are:

- ### Problem Estimators  
  - Multivariate Quadratic
  - Binary Syndrome Decoding
  - Syndrome Decoding over Fq
  - Permuted Kernel
  - Permutation Equivalence
  - Linear Equivalence
  - MinRank 
  - Regular Syndrome Decoding

- ### Scheme Estimators
  - UOV

You can also access the estimators through [this](https://estimators.crypto.tii.ae/) user friendly and installation-free web application.


## Getting Started 🚀
This project is meant to be run through a terminal or inside a docker container.

---
## Pre-requisites ✔️
### Local
You would need to have Sage installed in your machine. For this follow the instructions described [here](https://www.sagemath.org/). 
### Docker
You would need to have Docker installed in your machine. For this follow the instructions described [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

---
## Installation 🛠
### Local
Once you've Sage installed you can go to this project folder and run `make install` in a terminal. This will install `cryptographic_estimators` library globally. If you encounter some permission error please try again adding `sudo` as a prefix.

### Docker
If you don’t have sage installed in your machine you can start with our dockerized app. First you will need to have running the DockerDesktop app, then open a new terminal, go to the project folder and run `make docker-build` or if you have Apple Silicon M1 Chip `make docker-build-m1`.

> Note: This process may take up to 15 or 20 minutes depending on your bandwith and  computer capacity.

## Running the project ✈️
### Local
Open the Sage interpreter in a terminal and try importing the library as the following example.
```python
sage: from cryptographic_estimators.SDEstimator import SDEstimator                                                                
sage: sd = SDEstimator(15,10,5)                                                                                                   
sage: sd.estimate() 
```
### Docker
Open a terminal and execute `make docker-run` to start the container, then you can run `sage` as if it were in local
```python
root@31d20617c222:/home/cryptographic_estimators# sage
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

sage:  
```
